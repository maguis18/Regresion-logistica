We met doing seasonal work in Yellowstone in 2004, and that was only the start of our ongoing adventure, which now includes two little girls.

We pride ourselves in knowing all of the secret spots in the surrounding Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. We have an informative guidebook which can be useful when planning your adventures. It includes information about all manners of trips in the surrounding dozen different mountain ranges: hiking, mountaineering, rock climbing, whitewater rafting, caving,  skiing/snowboarding/Xcountry, fishing, boating/rafting, horseback riding, large animal and bird spotting, and much more. We also offer up an up to date city guide with ideas on what to do in or awesome town in between trips into the wilderness.

We are a young outdoorsy couple with a lot of travel experience, mostly in the big empty lands of our world. We are open to all types of people, whether young, old, LGBT, religious/athiest, brown, white, yellow, pink, or purple.

During that time our family lived abroad in Lugano, Switzerland, and then Surrey, England for over 9 years, returning to our home once or twice a year to stay in touch with lovely Bozeman and our wonderful local friends. We are originally from Connecticut and have lots of family there that we visit regularly. I’ve been back in Bozeman full time for about 8 years and love all the many activities MT has to offer including skiing, snow shoeing, hiking, cycling, camping, tennis, pickleball, yoga  and so much more. 

I have two sons, one who graduated from the US Naval Academy Annapolis and is now a Marine Officer stationed at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. The other graduated from University College London, England Medical School and is currently working as a doctor in London and is a competitive rower. 

I’m busy managing my rental properties located on the edge of the MSU campus and our lovely Yellow Dogs guest Cottage along with working as a Property Manager for others. 

Our Yellow Dogs are named Rumo & Tater.  You will occasionally see them playing and chasing balls in the fenced in backyard.
